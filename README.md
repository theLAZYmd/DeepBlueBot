# DeepBlueBot
Chess Ratings Tracker bot, basic javascript written by EikaMikiku. Modified by LAZY.

This bot is active in the [Discord Chess Lounge](https://discord.gg/5Eg47sR), under instructions from IsaVulpes#5970 and maintained by theLAZYmd#2353.

This project is in a psuedo-archived state, because there is no progress that needs to be made with it and what it does it does in a manner that just about works and no more.
There are no new features added to the architecture of this bot.
To see a bot that incorporates ideas from this one in active development with new features, view [this repo](https://github.com/theLAZYmd/LAZYbot).
